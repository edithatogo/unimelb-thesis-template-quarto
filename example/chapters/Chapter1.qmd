# Introduction {#ch-introduction}

This chapter serves as an introduction to the thesis template and demonstrates various features, including citations, figures, tables, equations, and code listings.
The structure of this document is based on the University of Melbourne's guidelines for thesis preparation.
Key works in the field of document preparation include those by Knuth [@Knuth1984] and Lamport [@Lamport1986].
We use LaTeX to typeset this document. We also use a Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Further resources can be found on the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN) [@CTAN].

## Citations and Bibliography {#sec-citations}

This template uses `biblatex` for bibliography management, which offers great flexibility.
Here are some examples of citation commands:

*   `@key`: Basic citation, e.g., [@Reference1].
*   Parenthetical citation, e.g., [@Reference2].
*   Textual citation, e.g., @Reference3 showed that...
*   Context-aware citation, e.g., [@Hao2023].
*   Multiple citations: [@Reference1; @Reference2].
*   Citations with page numbers: See [@Knuth1984, p. 15] for details.
*   Another example: @Lamport1986 [see Chapter 3] provides an overview.

The bibliography is automatically generated at the end of the document.

## Figures and Subfigures {#sec-figures}

Figures are crucial in a thesis. This template uses the `graphicx` package for including images and `subcaption` for handling subfigures.
Always use vector graphics (like PDF or EPS) when possible for diagrams and plots to ensure scalability. For photographs, high-resolution raster graphics (PNG, JPG) are appropriate.

```{r}
#| label: fig-tikz_example
#| fig-cap: "Example of a figure created with `tikz`."
#| echo: false
# Placeholder for the tikz figure.
# In a real Quarto document, you could use the tikz-engine
# or include a pre-rendered SVG/PDF.
plot(1, type="n", xlab="", ylab="", axes=F)
text(1, 1, "Placeholder for TikZ figure")
```

@fig-tikz_example shows a simple figure. For more complex layouts, subfigures can be used, as shown in @fig-subfigures_example.

::: {#fig-subfigures_example layout-ncol=2}

![First subfigure.](figures/unimelb_logo.eps){#fig-subfigure_a}

![Second subfigure.](figures/unimelb_logo.eps){#fig-subfigure_b}

Example of two subfigures.
:::

Refer to subfigure @fig-subfigure_a or @fig-subfigure_b when discussing specific parts.

## Tables {#sec-tables}

The `booktabs` package is included for creating professional-quality tables. It encourages avoiding vertical rules and using horizontal rules sparingly.
@tbl-example_table provides an illustration.

| Item          | Value 1 (V) | Value 2 (A) |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| Measurement 1 | 123.45      | 67.8        |
| Measurement 2 | 1.23        | 45.6        |
| Measurement 3 | 9.0         | 7.8         |

## Mathematical Equations {#sec-equations}

The `amsmath` package provides numerous environments for typesetting mathematics.
Here's a simple numbered equation, Equation @eq-einstein:

$$ E = mc^2 $${#eq-einstein}

For a set of aligned equations, use the `align` environment, like in Equations @eq-align_start and @eq-align_end:

$$
\begin{align}
    a + b &= c \label{eq:align_start} \\
    x + y + z &= w \label{eq:align_end}
\end{align}
$${#eq-align}

The `gather` environment can be used for centering multiple equations:

$$
\begin{gather}
    \int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \label{eq:gaussian_integral} \\
    \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6} \label{eq:basel_problem}
\end{gather}
$${#eq-gather}

Refer to @ch-introduction for more examples, or a specific @sec-equations.

## Code Listings {#sec-code}

Quarto supports code listings with syntax highlighting.
@lst-python_example shows a Python example.

```python
def greet(name):
    """This function greets the person passed in as a parameter."""
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Example usage
greet("World")
```
{#lst-python_example caption="A simple Python function."}

This concludes the demonstration of common thesis elements.
